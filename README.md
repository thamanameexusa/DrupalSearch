Sublime 3 Plugin helps to search change records of the [Drupal 7 hooks][drupal-hook-link] (core and contrib modules).

This package adds:

* A `DrupalSearch` command to the context menu for the selected
* A pallete command for the current selection(or word)
* A pallete command that will ask you what to search within Drupal core
* A pallete command that will ask you what to search within Drupal contrib modules

## Keybindings
- To search from selected text (core hooks):  `alt+shift+d`, `alt+shift+s`
- To search from user imput (core hooks):  `alt+shift+d`, `alt+shift+i`
- To search from user imput (contrib modules hooks):  `alt+shift+o`, `alt+shift+i`

## Install
